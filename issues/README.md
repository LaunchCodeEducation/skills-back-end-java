## Urgent Issues

Urgent issues are those that prevent you from working on class material. Examples include an error in assignment starter code or a broken link for a walkthrough video. Report these immediately in the `#errata` channel on Slack. Be sure to tag a staff member (`@chris`, `@sarah`, or `@anna`) so that they are notified.

## Non-urgent Issues and Enhancements

Typos or similar "non-blocking" issues should be reported as [issues on the GitHub repository for this site](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/skills-back-end-java/issues).

We also appreciate suggestions for enhancements to the course site or course material via GitHub issues.
