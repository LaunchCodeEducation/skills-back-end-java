Work on these exercises in the `java-exercises` project, creating a new class for each. You may name the classes whatever you like, but use proper [Java naming conventions](../../java4python/naming-conventions/).

1. **Input/output**: Modify your `HelloWorld` program to prompt the user for their name, and greet them by name.
1. **Numeric types**: Write a program to calculate the area of a rectangle and print the answer to the console. You should prompt the user for the dimensions. (What data types should the dimensions be?)
2. **Numeric types**: Write a program that asks a user for the number of miles they have driven and the amount of gas they've consumed (in gallons), and print their miles-per-gallon.
3. **Strings**: The first sentence of *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* is below. Store this sentence in a string, and then prompt the user for a term to search for within this string. Print whether or not the search term was found. See if you can make the search case-insensitive, so that searching for "alice" prints `true`.
    ```nohighlight
    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'
