# Java Track

#### Synopsis

The Java track covers the essentials of Java development:

* **Objects and Classes**: An Object is the basis of everything in Java. These powerful constructs have a wide range of uses.
* **GUIs** A graphical user interface is a nice, clean way for users to interact with your program.
* **Unit Tests** are an important piece of any program. We don't know if something works unless we test it!
* **Inheritance and Interfaces** are useful for leveraging common behaviors and functionality across your classes.
* **Exceptions** are used to inform users of invalid inputs or unexpected behaviors.

Once you complete these classes, you will be well equipped to create a final project!
