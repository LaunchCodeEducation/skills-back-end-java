This is your final assignment of the unit. Congrats for making it this far! You're almost to the end...

This assignment is a bit different from previous assignments. It's structured as a guided walkthrough. You'll be writing code step-by-step with our guidance.

## Learning Objectives

- Configure an individual class to be managed by Spring Data
- Configure a one-to-many relationship to be managed by Spring Data
- Configure a many-to-many relationship to be managed by Spring Data

## Your Tasks

You will work with the `cheese-mvc` application to add ORM functionality by using Spring Data. Follow the tutorials on the [CheeseMVC Persistent studio page](../../studios/cheese-mvc-persistent/). Complete all three parts.

You will have some time to work on these items in class, but you are ultimately responsible for completing all three sections on your own by the due date.

### How to Submit

To turn in your assignment and get credit, follow the [submission instructions][submission-instructions].
