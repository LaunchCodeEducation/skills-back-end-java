## Notes

ORM (object-relational mapping) is a technique for storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting in an object-oriented program using a relational database.

A data layer is typically a library written in the OO language that is part of, or works in conjunction with, your web framework. It is used to manage translations between the OO and relational worlds.

*CRUD* stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete and is the acronym used to describe the most common database tasks.
